# ONE MINUTE PUITCH APPLICATION
#### This Application is updated version, 7/09/2018
#### By **Duncan Arani**
## Description
this Application is used to display your blogs and blogs posted by others then you can like or dislike blogs posted by others and you can also comment on the other's blogs.
##Requirements
Python 2.7+, because that's just what Flask recommends.  
`tmux` to keep the blog running.

Everything else is listed in the `requirements.txt` file.  
You might also want to make sure that you have `sql` installed on your system so that you can generate the database.

I will not be providing any support for Windows users.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
##Getting started
===============

If you don't care about recent features and just want a stable working release. Check the tags. Every version of the code that I've been using in production without problems for longer periods of time will be listed there.  
Note that no real tests have been run. I just know that they've been functional for multiple days without major issues.

Setup is fairly easy for this application due to the nature of how it's built. However, I will inform you ahead of time that this is not designed for high-traffic load. Due to things like SQLite usage.

1. Clone the repository into a folder anywhere you wish
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment for the project
3. Install everything listed in requirements.txt using `pip install -r requirements.txt` or do it manually
4. Proceed with the relevant procedure fitting your use case below

###Production
----------

1. Edit the variables in `exec.py` to fit your needs, **Make sure you remove `debug=True` from `app.run()` for security reasons, you should also make sure that `host="<something>"` is set to `127.0.0.1` for step 3**
2. Generate the sqlite database by running `sqlite3 blog.db < schema.sql` in the directory where you cloned the repo
3. Set up a proper webserver to handle your requests. I recommend nginx. Configure it as a reverse proxy for your desired subdomain or url, pointing to `127.0.0.1` and whatever port you defined in `exec.py`
4. Do `python exec.py`
5. (Optional) It's recommended that you configure your webserver to handle static files for you. This can greatly improve performance and in some cases, security. If you don't know how to do it, the application will server static files for you worst-case.

####Goals
=====

This project was started to learn some basic Flask and Python features that could come in handy later. Mainly, these features are:

* Using markdown
* Handling files
* Templating
* Some lazy single-user login just to test the session feature
* ~~Not sure if DB (prolly just SQLite) or static files~~ SQLite apparently
* Getting used to route-based web development

##Usage
=====

This is really simple at the moment.

* You can log in, you must do this before anything else on this list will work
* A logout link and a link to the post editor will appear.
* To edit a post, use the link added to the post page. Alternatively, add `/edit` to the post url.
